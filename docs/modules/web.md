# Web & GDPR Module

The Web module handles **webstore integration**, **VIP kit delivery**, **payment webhooks**, and **GDPR compliance** — giving players control over their personal data.

---

## GDPR Compliance

Players can export, delete, and manage consent for their stored data directly in-game.

### Commands

All GDPR commands are player-only and require no special permission (GDPR compliance requires they be accessible to all players).

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/nexus gdpr` | Show GDPR info and current consent settings |
| `/nexus gdpr export` | Export all personal data to a JSON file in `gdpr/` |
| `/nexus gdpr delete` | Delete all personal data (right to erasure) |
| `/nexus consent <type> <accept\|deny>` | Grant or deny a specific consent type |

### Consent Types

| Consent Type | What It Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `activity_tracking` | Join/leave/playtime data |
| `purchase_history` | Transaction records |
| `discord_notifications` | Discord-linked player actions |
| `statistics` | Player stats and achievements |
| `marketing` | Server announcements and promotions |

On first join, players receive a prompt to accept or deny `activity_tracking`. Other consent types can be managed anytime via `/nexus consent`.

!!! info "Data deletion"
    Financial records newer than `gdpr.legal-retention-years` are **anonymised** rather than deleted, to comply with legal minimum retention requirements. All other data is removed immediately.

---

## Webstore Integration

The module bridges an external webstore with the plugin for **automatic kit delivery** and **payment verification**.

### VIP Kit Delivery

When a player purchases a rank or kit on the webstore, the order is queued. On the player's next join, `auto-deliver: true` delivers the kit automatically.

Kits are defined in `kits.yml`:

```yaml
kits:
  VIP:
    items:
      - material: DIAMOND
        amount: 5
      - nexusprism-item: RESEARCH_PARCHMENT_BASIC
        amount: 1
    commands:
      - "lp user {player} group set vip"
      - "tell {player} Welcome to VIP!"
  MVP:
    items:
      - material: NETHERITE_INGOT
        amount: 3
    commands:
      - "lp user {player} group set mvp"
```

---

## Security

### Data Encryption

When `security.enable-encryption: true` (default), sensitive data stored by the web module is encrypted with **AES-256-CBC** using a random IV per entry. The key is generated once and persisted to `plugins/NexusPrism/web/encryption.key`.

!!! warning "Back up encryption.key"
    If this file is lost, previously encrypted data cannot be decrypted. Include it in your server backups. Never commit it to a git repository.

### Stream Panel Receiver Secret

The plugin opens an HTTP port (`nexus-tools.receiver-port`, default `8080`) to receive Twitch events from the [Stream Panel](https://github.com/O-Tiger/WebServiceTwitchBot). Set `nexus-tools.receiver-secret` to a shared secret and configure the same value in the Stream Panel's nexus-tools integration. Requests without a matching `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` header are rejected with 401.

Leave empty only in isolated local development environments.
