# Enchantments Module

The Enchantments module adds **175 custom enchantments** across 6 rarity tiers and 10 trigger types. All enchants are defined in `enchants/config.yml` — no Java code required to add new ones.

## How Enchant Books Work

- Right-clicking an enchant book applies it to the item in the **offhand slot**
- Enchants are stored via **PDC** (Persistent Data Container) with key `enchant_<id>`
- Applied enchants appear in the item lore as `<Color><Name> <Roman numeral> §8[Enchant]`
- The enchanting table can offer custom enchants when `obtain-defaults.enchanting-table: true`
