# MMO Module

The MMO module transforms NexusSlime into a light RPG experience. Players earn an **MMO level**, allocate **stat points**, level up **six skill trees**, unlock and use **abilities**, and progress through **eight professions** — each with a unique mastery passive.

---

## MMO Level & Stat Points

Players earn MMO XP from any in-game activity (combat, professions, skill trees). Leveling up grants **1 unspent stat point** to spend freely.

### XP to Level Formula

```
xpToLevel(n) = 100 × 2^((n-1) / 10)
```

The XP requirement doubles every 10 levels.

### Stats

| Stat | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `MAX_HEALTH` | Increases maximum hearts |
| `STRENGTH` | +1.5% melee damage per point |
| `DEFENSE` | -0.8% damage taken per point (max 80% reduction) |
| `AGILITY` | +0.5% dodge chance per point (hit cancelled, "Dodged!" in actionbar) |
| `INTELLIGENCE` | Increases magic ability power |
| `WISDOM` | Affects healing effectiveness and mana-equivalent costs |
| `LUCK` | Improves drop rates and random outcomes |
| `CRIT_CHANCE` | +1% critical hit chance per point (max 95%) |
| `CRIT_DAMAGE` | Crit multiplier = `1.5 + (critDamage × 0.01)` |
| `MAGIC_POWER` | Amplifies magic ability damage |
| `MINING_SPEED` | Increases block break speed |
| `FISHING_LUCK` | Improves fishing treasure quality |

**Final stat value** = base (player-allocated) + skill tree bonuses + future equipment bonuses.
